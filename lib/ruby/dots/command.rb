The DOTS Project

DOTS is a ZSH Framework for managing your dotfiles and other shell configuration.
It also gives you some nice, sensible defaults and time-saver aliases to better
work with and understand your shell environment.

The following tasks are meant to help you use the shell more efficiently...

      TEXT
