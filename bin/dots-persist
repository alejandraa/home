#
#     dots persist FILE - Save a config file to your personal DOTS repo.
#
# == Usage
#
# Copies a configuration file from the home directory into
# `~/.dots/config` in order to "save" its changes in your personal DOTS
# repository. It then symlinks the file back to its original location to
# preserve file path integrity.
#
# == Installation
#
# This program comes for free when you install DOTS.
